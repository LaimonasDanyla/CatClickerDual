# CatClickerDual
Udacity project task with changed requirements

Files copied from working CatCliker for further implementation of new requirements. 

New Project Requirements for Cat Clicker
Visuals
The application should display two cats. Each cat includes
-the cat's name
-a picture of the cat
-text showing the number of clicks
The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.
Interaction
The number of clicks should increment when each cat picture is clicked. 

Recomendation was set cats name into variable and update the DOM.
